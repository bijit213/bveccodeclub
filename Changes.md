Hello,
I am Bijit Acharjee
1st semester CSE, BVEC

i just changed the nav bar manu css. From all the html file I seperate the 'a clas="icon"' from div.topnav  and also in style.css i linked another hover to 'a class="icon"'.
Here, i seperate the media style directly to the gallery.html for the better styling 
I did not make ay change in the js file as i feel there is no error in the script.js file. program can be modernize by using Let instead of Var so that i could be benificial new js learner as var is not use in now day. Here i learnt javascript without using var, but i know it is used as "Global scope veriable"

vision:
I did not explore the entire webide of code club, still i found some of the error i the team file about its "i" mediaIcon. I had a vision to change the "team" file to  file Named "Founding members" . This file contains the data of the founding members 
and add another file named "Members" which contains the data of the current members
